# Senior-Project63
This project has been developed for automatic seat detection, particularly in the Engineering Faculty cafeteria at Naresuan University.
The system has been developed using OpenCV in conjunction with YOLOv8 for automatic seat detection. 
Subsequently, the obtained results are sent and displayed on a web application created using the Flask framework.

## Installation
#### Create Python Environment 
- ``` py -3 -m venv .venv```
- ``` .venv\Scripts\activate```
#### Install Flask Framework
``` pip install Flask ```
#### Install OpenCV & Yolov8
- ```pip install opencv-python```
- ```pip install ultralytics ```

## Testing
